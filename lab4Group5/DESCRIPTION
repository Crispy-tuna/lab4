Description: lab04 is a package to handle linear regression models. 
    It will use linear algebra to create the most basic functionality in 
    the R package. It will implement an object oriented system to 
    handle special functions such as print(),plot(),resid(),pred(),
    coef() and summary(). It also has a vignette on how the package 
    can be used to conduct a simple regression analysis 
    using a dataset included in the package.
